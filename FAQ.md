# Valour Frequently Asked Questions

## On the Valour website there is only a logo! Is this supposed to happen?
Yes. Valour is not in a state ready enough to be live publicly.
## When do you think Valour will come out?
We plan on having an early alpha by the end of January 2021.
## Will Valour have a Voice Chat?
It is not planned to have a voice chat due to the high cost of hosting until there is a minimum viable product and or funding
### *Why couldn't you just make people host the voice chats locally?*
Local hosting would not be secure for people as the person hosting it could steal their data. Even if it was encrypted Valour would have to process and proxy it which would cost money.
## I have a SpookVooper account, will I have to make a Valour account?
All SpookVooper accounts will be migrated to Valour accounts once Valour is in a viable state. After this SpookVooper will use Valour as logins.
## Will Valour have a mobile version?
Valour will eventually have a mobile version once there is a minimum viable product.
## Is there going to be a Linux version?
Linux version will be developed once a viable product is achieved. Until then Linux users can use the browser app.
## Is there anything I have to worry about if I make something for Valour?
Due to Valour's AGPL3 license, you can modify or use Valour however you want however it must be opensource. For more info visit [LICENSE](https://github.com/SpikeViper/Valour/blob/main/LICENSE).
## What are planets and systems?
Planets are where your community will be on. There will be chat rooms and categories. Systems are an optional collection of planets. They would be primarily used for large communities or with many separate different sub-communities. For example, a nation roleplay where is multiple nations. Each nation would have its planet and they would be all in the one system for their roleplay.
## How will Systems and Planets be organized?
System roles would be applied to every planet within the system. This would also apply the permission the system user has onto the planet and planets would have their roles as well. This means if someone was a system admin they would also be an admin on planets within the system.
## Will there be custom themes for planets?
You will be able to customize your planets with different themes. It is most likely going to be custom CSS but it might change in the future.
## Can I have sub-categories?
Yes, you can have as many as you want on your planet.
## How will Valour be monetized?
In the future, Valour will be monetized using a subscription for communities and possibly one for specific users as well.
## How will Valour handle user reports?
Valour will prioritize user reports that break the law such as doxxing, illegal material, extortion, etc... We will also confirm if a user did send certain messages. Valour will not punish people for being offensive however and only assure safety and law.
